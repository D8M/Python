# Exercises with Lists & Tuples

# l & T are both classes, they hold ordered collection of elements, they can be sliced, or searched.
# Tuples are immuatable, they cannot be appended to or individually deleted from, Lists can as they are mutable.
# Lists & Tuples can contain elements of differing data types in Py.
# Both have Elements accessed starting at index 0
# Lists use [] while Tuples use ()
